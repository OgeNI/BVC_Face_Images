A database of Nigerian face images - BVC-UNN-face data, was collected by the Biometrics Vision and Computing (BVC) group at the University of Nigeria in 2018. We are making the BVC-UNN-face data free and publicly available with the spirit of promoting the sharing of academic knowledge. The BVC group through the University of Nigeria retains ownership and copyright of the BVC-face dataset. The BVC-face data is distributed via the University of Notre Dame.
A formal request is required to use the BVC-face data. In other words, a researcher requesting for the dataset is required to fill a formal agreement and return to us via his/her institutional email.
